    <p>Anyone who works with computers learns to fear their capacity to forget. Like so many things with computers, memory is strictly binary. There is either perfect <span class="google recall">recall</span> or total oblivion, with nothing in between. It doesn't matter how important or trivial the information is. The <span class="google computer">COMPUTER</span> can forget anything in an instant. If it remembers, it remembers for keeps.</p>
      <img class="appear computer__image"src="assets/images/computer.png">
      <img class="appear recall__image"src="assets/images/recall.png">

    <p>This doesn't map well onto human experience of memory, which is fuzzy. We don't <span class="google remember">remember</span> anything with perfect fidelity, but we're also not at risk of waking up having forgotten our own name. <span class="google memories">Memories</span> tend to fade with time, and we remember only the more salient events.</p>

    <img class="appear memories__image"src="assets/images/memories.png">

    <p>Every programmer has firsthand experience of accidentally deleting something important. Our <span class="google recall">folklore</span> as programmers is filled with stories of lost data, failed backups, inadvertently <span class="google clobbering">clobbering</span> some vital piece of information, undoing months of work with a <span class="rollover singlekey">single keystroke</span>. We learn to be <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/how-scared-should-i-be-of-the-internet-of-things"><span class="rollover AFRAID">afraid.</span></a></p>

    <img class="appear clobbering__image"src="assets/images/clobbering.png">


    <p>And because we live in a time when storage grows ever cheaper, we learn to save everything , log everything, and keep it forever. You never know what will come in useful. Deleting is <span class="google dangerous">dangerous</span>. There are no horror stories—yet—about keeping too much data for too long.</p>

    <img class="appear dangerous__image"src="assets/images/dangerous.png">

<p>Unfortunately, we've let this detail of how computers work <span class="google percolate">percolate</span> up into the design of our online communities. It's as if we forced people to use only <span class="google integers">integers</span> because computers have difficulty <span class="google representing">representing</span> real numbers.</p>

    <p>Our lives have become <span class="rollover">split </span><a href="http://www.naomijchan.com/interactive_5/"><img src="assets/images/split.png" class="thumbnailsplit"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between two worlds with two very different norms around memory.</p>

    <img class="appear split_info__image"src="assets/images/split_info.png">

    <p>The offline world works like it always has. I saw many of you talking yesterday between sessions; I bet none of you has a verbatim transcript <a href="https://www.artforum.com/index.php?pn=interview&id=1532"><img src="assets/images/transcript.jpg" class="thumbnail one" ></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those conversations. If you do, then I bet the people you were talking to would find that extremely creepy.</p>

    <img class="appear transcript_info__image"src="assets/images/transcript_info.png">

    <p>I saw people taking pictures, but there's a nice set of gestures and conventions in place for that. You lift your camera or phone when you want to <a href="http://www.insecam.org/"><span class="rollover record">record</span></a>, and people around you can see that. All in all, it works pretty smoothly.</p>

    <img class="appear record__image"src="assets/images/record.png">

    <p>The <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/33845/1/want-to-delete-yourself-from-the-internet-use-this-website"><span class="rollover">online world</span><img src="assets/images/online.gif" class="thumbnailonline"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is very different. Online, everything is recorded by default, and you may not know where or by whom. If you've ever wondered why Facebook is such a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/what-the-digital-resistance-movement-might-look-like"><span class="rollover">joyless place</span><img src="assets/images/joyless.jpeg" class="thumbnailjoyless"> </a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, even though we've theoretically surrounded ourselves with friends and loved ones, it's because of this need to constantly be wearing our public face. Facebook is about as much fun as a zoning board hearing.</p>
    <img class="appear online_info__image"src="assets/images/online_info.png">
    <img class="appear joyless_info__image"src="assets/images/joyless_info.png">

    <p>Google's answer is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXcdYBh3hgg"><span class="rollover wakeup">wake up </span><img src="assets/images/wakeup.gif" class="thumbnailwakeup" ></a>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grandpa, this is the new normal. But all they're doing is trying to port a bug in the Internet over to the real world, and calling it progress.</p>
    <img class="appear wakeup_info__image"src="assets/images/wakeup_info.png">

    <p>You can dress up a bug and call it a feature. You can also put <span class="red">DOG CRAP </span> <img src="assets/images/dogshit.png"  class="thumbnail" >in the freezer and call it ice cream. But people can taste the difference. </p>

    <p>And then there's the cloud. The cloud fascinates me because of the distance between what it promises and what it actually is.The cloud promises us complete liberation from the mundane world of hardware and infrastructure. It invites us to soar into an astral plane of pure computation, freed from the weary bonds of earth.</p>

    <p>What the cloud is is a big collection of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36151754"><span class="rollover building">buildings </span><img src="assets/images/building.jpg" class="thumbnailbuilding" ></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and computers that we actually know very little about,  run by a large American company notorious for being pretty terrible to its workers. Who knows what angry sysadmin lurks inside the cloud?</p>

    <img class="appear building_info__image"src="assets/images/building_info.png">

    <p>The cloud is a fog of sweet, sweet promises. Amazon promises eleven nines of durability. Eleven nines! The Sun will be a charred cinder before a single bit gets flipped in a file you've stored on S3.</p>

    <p>Amazon promises no single points of failure. Instead, you get a single cloud of failure, the promise that when the system comes crashing down, at least you won't be alone.</p>

    <p>The problem with these points of control, of course, is that they make it very easy to <a href="cloud.html"> spy on everyone.</a></p>
