   The reasons given by cloud services for such <span class="google realtwo">real</span> name requirements are <span class="google vague">vague</span>—perhaps for fear of sounding too directly authoritarian. The preferred route, instead, is that of fatherly advice. Facebook claims that it has a <span class="google realthree">real</span>
   name policy “so that you always know who you’re connecting with,”(10) while Google states that it requires <span class="google realfour">real</span> names so “that the people you want to connect with can find you.”36 These explanations <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgBvpjwOGo"><span class="rollover gesture">gesture </span><img src="assets/images/gesture.jpg" class="thumbnailgesture"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towards a <span class="google conception">conception</span> of normative social arrangements—requiring that your use the same name that you’d use among your friends, family, or coworkers. Alexis Madrigal points out a certain irony in the Google+ <span class="google realfive">real</span> name requirement.</p>

<blockquote>The kind of naming policy that Facebook and Google Plus have is actually a radical departure from the way identity and speech interact in the <span class="google realsix">real world</span>. They attach identity more strongly to every act of online speech than almost any <span class="google realseven">real</span> world situation does.37</blockquote>

  <p>Cloud providers such as <a href=" https://creators.vice.com/en_au/article/amazon-drone-delivery-is-actually-happening "><span class="rollover amazon">Amazon </span><img src="assets/images/amazon.jpg" class="thumbnailamazon"></a> &nbsp;&nbsp; use <span class="google realeight">real</span> name registration as a mechanism for accountability. Though Amazon still allows users to use a “pen name,” the trademarked “<span class="google realnine">real</span> name” attribution is advertised as having the ability to “potentially increase your reputation in the community” as a retailer, seller, or reviewer.38 Some see the <span class="google realten">real</span> name badge as a step towards “fixing their flawed [and] exploitable review system” for reviewing books—a system notoriously dominated by biased
  <a href=""><span class="rollover anonymous"> “anonymous” </span><img src="assets/images/anonymous.jpg" class="thumbnailanonymous"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  users, often thought to be, and sometimes proven to be, other authors, their family members, or the books’ publishers.39</p>

    <p> Though Amazon’s reasoning for promoting the use of <span class="google realeleven">real</span> names is more explicit than that of Facebook and Google+, one can imagine the marketing benefits of a <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlFtHuXPbv4"><span class="rollover synchronized">synchronized </span><img src="assets/images/synchronized.png" class="thumbnailsynchronized"></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="google realtwelve">real</span> name system between social media and retail websites—and the connection that such a synchronicity might have with the government. Such requirements can be seen as aligned with plans of the US government to introduce a universal “trusted identity” or “internet ID” system for US citizens, a commission the White House granted to the US Commerce Department in 2011. According to White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt, the effort entails nothing less than creating an “identity ecosystem” for the internet.40</p>
