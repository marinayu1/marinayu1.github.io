    <p>I'm going to start right out by saying it: <span class="red">If it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist.</span> I used to say this <span class="google hyperbolic">hyperbolically</span> but as <span class="google time">time</span> has gone on, it's proved to be a truism, perhaps the paradigmatic <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/530566/the-impact-of-the-internet-on-society-a-global-perspective/ ">truism <img src="assets/images/truism.jpg" class="thumbnailtruism" ></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of our <span class="google timetwo">times</span>. </p>

    <p>You might <span class="google deny">deny</span> this until you realize that much of your self-worth is derived from Googling <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/35935/1/louise-parker-reclaiming-identity-through-found-photos-of-yourself ">yourself; <img src="assets/images/yourself.jpg" class="thumbnailyourself" ></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you don't exist on the internet, you don't exist. </p>

    <p>You get frustrated as I do when you are researching in <span class="google front">front</span> of your computer and what you're looking for <span class="google showup">doesn't show up</span> on Google. Perhaps we are at the root of the  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11972106/I-took-myself-offline-completely.-Heres-why.html  ">problem.<img src="assets/images/offline.gif" class="thumbnailoffline" ></a></p>

    <p>It is our obligation as educators and intellectuals to make sure that the bulk of our production ends up there, preferably with free and unfettered access to all. This means not making materials available only for those affiliated with our institution, our students, or our colleagues, but giving free and unfettered access for all. Doing so means posting our works on the world wide web so that anyone, anywhere, at any <span class="google timethree">time</span> can have access to them. In this way, we will ensure that our work exists. </p>
