     Pier Luigi Nervi, (born June 21, 1891, Sondrio, Italy—died Jan. 9, 1979, Rome), Italian engineer and architect, internationally renowned for his technical ingenuity and dramatic sense of design, especially as applied to large-span structures built of reinforced concrete. His important works include a prefabricated 309-foot-span arch for the Turin Exhibition (1949–50) and the first skyscraper in Italy, the Pirelli Building (1955) in Milan, a collaborative design.<br>

     Nervi graduated from the University of Bologna in 1913. During World War I he served as a lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers of the Italian army, and after the war he worked as an engineer in Bologna and Florence. In 1926–27 he designed his first significant work, a cinema in Naples, and followed it with the municipal stadium (Berta Stadium) in Florence, built in 1930–32.<br>

     In 1932 Nervi and a cousin in Rome formed the contracting firm of Nervi and Bartoli, with which he would remain through the rest of his career. In 1935 the Italian air force held a competition for a series of hangars to be built throughout Italy. Nervi conceived them as concrete vaults, with huge spans, that could be constructed at low cost, and he was commissioned for the project. Between 1935 and 1941 he built hangars in Obertello, Orvieto, and Torre del Lago. All of these structures were destroyed during World War II.<br>

     Each of these early structures showed the growth of conceptual design that resulted from Nervi’s ceaseless search for new solutions to structural problems. His creativity was not confined to the design of buildings; during World War II, he attempted to construct vessels made of concrete for the Italian navy, but the project was not completed. After the war, he did succeed in building a 165-ton, motor-powered, concrete sailboat, with a hull 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) thick. Subsequently he built a 38-foot (11.6-metre) ketch, the Nennele, with a hull only a half inch thick. For both of these vessels, he used ferrocemento, a material of his own invention, composed of dense concrete, heavily reinforced with evenly distributed steel mesh that gives it both lightness and strength.<br>

     This material was vital in Nervi’s design for a complex he built for the Turin Exhibition in 1949–50—a prefabricated structure in the form of a corrugated cylindrical arch, spanning 309 feet (93 m), based on modular components of glass and ferrocemento. Without the structural properties of this material, the entire conception would have been infeasible.<br>

    The growth of conceptual design that resulted from Nervi’s.<br><br>

    Never mentioned in his books, though always remembered as one of his dearest works, the Augusteo Cinema-Theatre confirms Pier Luigi Nervi’s ability to devise daring statically indeterminate structural solutions, whose control is entrusted more to intuition and practical experience than to rigorous preventive calculation. In this project he advanced his research into three-dimensional systems in reinforced concrete frames, conceived as load resistant skeletons integrated within the load bearing masonry walls.<br><br>

Located in the dense fabric of the historical central of Naples, the building is the fruit of a modern real estate operation on the Vomero Hill. The author of the project is the Roman architect Arnaldo Foschini, who commissioned Nervi & Nebbiosi to manage the difficult realization of the roof. Nervi was thirty-five at the time, and by now a well-known designer-builder who had already dealt, on more than one occasion, with difficult roof structures over large public spaces while working for Attilio Muggia’s Sacc. What is more, Nervi & Nebbiosi had recently completed the 24-meter span reinforced concrete roof at the Banchini Theatre in Prato.<br><br>

However, the project in Naples was more complex. The most significant structure is the roof of the vast hall, 30 meters in diameter, with an operable skylight at the centre. It is composed of a radial system of 18 trusses, used to cantilever a series of tapered brackets, connected at their ends by a ring that defines the central void opening. The beams are the same height as the inhabitable top floor, with the diagonal braces concealed inside the walls dividing the office spaces. The horizontal connections between the columns, along the perimeter of the interior of the hall, are made at the corners to create a large annular Vierendel truss that contributes to the torsional stability of the entire system. Finally, the two floor and roof slabs are used to strengthen the structure in the horizontal plane.<br><br>
The Berta Stadium, thanks to its extraordinary critical fortune and the presentations made by Piero Maria Bardi in Quadrante, and by Giovanni Michelucci in Architettura, is the work that offered Nervi access to the world of architecture, consecrated by his participation in the exhibition of Rationalist Architecture presented in Florence and curated by Michelucci and Adalberto Libera in 1932. In fact, Nervi demonstrated an attentive awareness of the theoretical and design considerations of the Italian Rationalist Movement (Miar and Gruppo 7), whose members recognized, in him and his company, the possibility to manage new building technologies and the same elements of a new architectural language, during the delicate passage from programmatic

        declarations to real experiments.Promoted by the Gruppo Rionale Fascista, the project, initially prepared by the Municipal Technical Office, was entrusted to Nervi & Nebbiosi at the end of 1930. A few months prior, the company had presented a daring proposal for the realization of the grand stands: a reinforced concrete canopy with a 22.5 meter cantilever, resting on 15 load bearing brackets with a curved section, strengthened by two transversal beams; a sort of static paradox whose equilibrium is achieved in virtue of the actions of the beam and the counterweight provided by the stands.

        An alternative project to that known prior to now, dated between 1930-31 and only recently rediscovered, speaks of an engineer searching for a suitable architectural language that employs the techniques of representation of the avant-garde and uses formal solutions comparable to certain contemporary works by Adalberto Libera and Mario Ridolfi. In reality, Nervi prepared the definitive project in phases, between 1931 and 1932, the same year he ended his partnership with Nebbiosi to found Nervi & Bartoli. Nervi developed all the covered stands, the stepped seating, the heliocoidal stairs and the Maratona Tower as

        construction progressed. For the design of the new stands and the Maratona Tower, he once again made recourse to static paradoxes: for the stairs, a tapered slab surmounted by the steps is cantilevered from a large heliocoidal beam, while the forces are re-balanced by another woven beam, symmetrical and inverse, that creates a spatially framed structure; while the tower, a 55-meter tall glazed spindle incorporating an exposed elevator, rests on a cantilevered slab. In 1950-51 Nervi was awarded the design of the enlargement of the Stadium: two, 114-metre long elevated tribunes, with four new heliocoidal stairs.

          Between 1935 and the years of the War, Nervi and his company constructed various airplane hangars in reinforced concrete for the Regia Aeronautica militare (Italian Royal Air Force). Eight are the result of the development of a unique project for a ribbed vault with a geodetic structure, constituted of a series of arches overlapping one another at 45°, with a maximum span of 50 meters. Nervi arrived at this solution after a series of successive elaborations, initially studied for the Ciampino Airport [in Rome] in 1935, beginning with much more traditional schemes based on a portal and overlapping trusses. For the first time in the work of Nervi, the verification of the appropriateness of the structural concept and the refinement of the construction drawings made use of small scale models realized by the Politecnico di Milano, under the supervision of Guido Oberti. The first two hangars (1935-38), entirely site-cast, were realized for the military airport in Orvieto; the successive six hangars (1939-42), located between Orvieto, Orbetello and Torre del Lago, used the same geometric matrix as the first two, while proposing a drastic reconsideration of the building processes: realized by assembling the lightweight elements of the structure, prefabricated in the building yard, with the sole integration of strengthening ribs in solid walls in the areas most subject to loading, anticipating the widespread use of structural prefabrication pursued by Nervi during the post-war period. <br> <br>
