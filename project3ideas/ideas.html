If It Doesn't Exist on the Internet, It Doesn't Exist
Kenneth Goldsmith, 2005 <br>

The Internet With A Human Face
Maciej Cegłowski, 2014</P>

<h1>how they relate</h1>
<p>They talk about the risks that come with the internet. Although it is a wondrous place, it also has a lot of potholes that many people are simply unaware of as well as the dangers of the vast capabilities for it to store information. For example, the ability for  the internet to remember everything, which is unlike the human brain. Articles talk about the dangers of this extensive memory, eg permanent record as well as the issue of privacy when it comes to The Cloud. Talks about the dangers The cloud can bring, in that it isn't in fact private and the government is able to access everything. These articles also similarly talk about the loss of information and its complete irrelevance to the world when this information isn't hoarded. Eg old social accounts whereby the platform became extinct and how if it doesn't exist online anymore it doesn’t exist. A whole dimension that people cannot physically. reach and cannot obtain the information, therefore makes to impact to society.</p>

<p>Do you think information becomes completely irrelevant when it is lost online? And if not, how can we make it still relevant if the internet doesn't remember it?<br>

The memory storage of the internet in incredibly stronger than the human brain? Do you think humans will try to adopt “internet memory” into real life and will this harm the human race?<br>

If we adopt internet memory into real life, how are we able to control the issue of privacy? Will there even be privacy or does the definition privacy obtain a different meaning in the context of the internet world?<br></p>
